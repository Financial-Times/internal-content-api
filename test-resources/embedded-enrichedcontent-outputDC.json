The centre-left party held on to only nine seats, down from 38 in the previous election. Many supporters defecting to other leftwing parties after Labour helped to push through reforms such as raising the retirement age and altering the Dutch healthcare system. \n</p>\n<p>The results reflected the highly fragmented nature of Dutch politics, with the top six parties winning between 14 and 33 seats each.

Now a common commitment to change and relaunch the Union.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest winners of the election was the Green Left party which won votes at the expense of Labour. On Wednesday night, Jesse Klaver, the 30-year-old Green Left leader, took the stage in front of euphoric, young supporters in a converted factory in Amsterdam that is primarily used to host club nights. “We had hoped that the result would be historic,” said the leader. “It was!”</p>\n\n\n<ft-content data-embedded=\"true\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\" url=\"http://test.api.ft.com/content/c0cde042-0a1f-11e7-323c-07a1fb42b00a\"></ft-content>\n<p>Green Left, which mopped up votes among younger voters, celebrated by posting a picture of Kermit the Frog shaking with delight on Twitter. At the rally, Mr Klaver said he had been asked repeatedly throughout the campaign by international journalists whether populists would succeed in the election. “No!” chanted the audience.</p>\n<p>In total, 28 parties entered the ballot, some barely a few years old.
